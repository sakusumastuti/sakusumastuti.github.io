I am an assistant professor at [BMS-CoDE](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/code/), University of Twente. Prior to this appointment I was a postdoctoral researcher in human factors at CoDe in collaboration with [ProRail](https://www.prorail.nl/) for [Europe's Rail Joint Undertaking (ERJU)](https://rail-research.europa.eu/) 

I recieved my PhD and M.A. in Quantitative Psychology under [Dr. Richard S. John](https://create.usc.edu/create_teams/richard-john/) in the [Quantitative Methods and Computational Psychology (QMCP)](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/qmcp/) group in the Department of Psychology at University of Southern California, as well as a [B.Sc in Mathematical Statistics](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/news/2014/spring_2014_grads.html) from Purdue University.

My research incorporates knowledge from the domain of judgment and decision making, experimental psychology, simulations, psychological measurement, and general quantitative social science methods to approach problems related to human factors, risk perception, decision analysis, transportation and human-computer interaction. My work covers various topics from decision making in cybersecurity from the perspective of users and attackers, examining the implication of empirical results to foundations of multiattribute methods, to designing human-in-the-loop simulation experiments for rail research. 
A recent emerging direction to my research focus involves human-technology interaction, particularly trust in automation and AI.

On my free time I like to watch films and try to watch two films a week. My four favourite films are Beau Travail (1999, dir. Clair Denis), Wings of Desire/Der Himmel über Berlin (1987, dir. Wim Wenders), Wild at Heart (1992, dir. David Lynch), and The Needle/Игла (1988, dir. Rashid Nugmanov). My other hobbies include traveling, lifting weights, collecting maps, and watching sumo wrestling.
