<I>Abbreviated Abstract</i>: Information uncertainty is ubiquitous in everyday life. In this study, we examine whether brief, focused practice can improve people's ability to understand and integrate bivariate Gaussian uncertainty visualized via ensemble displays, summary displays, and distributional displays, and we examine whether this is influenced by the complexity of the displayed information. In two experiments (N=118 and 56), decision making was faster and more accurate after practice relative to before practice. Furthermore, the performance improvements transferred to use of display types that were not practiced.
