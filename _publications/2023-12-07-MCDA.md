<I>Abbreviated Abstract:</i> Empirical evidence suggests that decision-makers are ill-equipped to identify all relevant objectives in a decision problem. We examine the effect of an incomplete set of objectives using a Monte Carlo simulation to compare a baseline model to a reduced model incorporating only a subset of objectives. We assess the performance of reduced models varying in the number of objectives, the number of alternatives, the correlations among objectives, and attribute weights.
